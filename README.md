**Image Annotation:**

Image annotation is the process of labeling and adding metadata to images to provide information about specific objects or features within the images. Annotations are crucial for training machine learning models, particularly in computer vision tasks. Different types of annotations provide diverse information about the content of images. Here are brief descriptions of common image annotations:

1. **Bounding Box Annotation:**
   - Defines rectangular regions around objects of interest.
   - Contains coordinates (x, y) of the box's top-left corner, width, and height.

2. **Polygon Annotation:**
   - Represents object shapes using a series of connected vertices.
   - Describes complex object boundaries more accurately than bounding boxes.

3. **Segmentation Mask Annotation:**
   - Provides pixel-level masks to identify object boundaries precisely.
   - Each pixel is labeled as part of the object or background.

4. **Keypoint Annotation:**
   - Identifies specific points of interest on objects.
   - Commonly used for human pose estimation or object keypoints.

5. **Line Annotation:**
   - Specifies linear features within an image.
   - Useful for tasks involving road markings, boundaries, or trajectory analysis.

6. **Text Annotation:**
   - Adds textual information to images.
   - Often used for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) training.

7. **Depth Annotation:**
   - Assigns depth information to pixels in the image.
   - Important for applications like 3D reconstruction and depth estimation.

8. **Time Annotation:**
   - Associates time-related information with specific image frames.
   - Useful for video analysis and temporal tasks.
